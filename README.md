# PetFriendly Travel App 🐾

A mobile-first web app that helps travelers with pets find **pet-friendly hotels** and accommodation worldwide.

## 🌍 What It Does

- Search hotels by city
- Show only **pet-friendly stays**
- Display hotel name, location, and a link to view/book
- Future version will include:
  - Reviews from other pet owners
  - Pet size/type filters (e.g., cats, large dogs)
  - Parks and nearby services

## 🔧 Built With

- Claude (No-code starter)
- HTML/CSS
- Future: Travelpayouts API for hotel data

## 💡 Why I’m Building This

As a pet owner, it’s often difficult to find places that welcome pets when traveling. This app is a tool to help pet parents feel confident planning their trips — without surprise restrictions at hotels.

## 🚀 Roadmap

- [x] Build working frontend (Bolt)
- [ ] Connect to hotel API (Travelpayouts)
- [ ] Add filter for pet size/type
- [ ] Deploy to App Store
